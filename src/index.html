    <h1>Antoine de Saint Exupéry - The little prince</h1>
    <h2>TO LEON WERTH</h2>
    <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
        dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best
        friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
        understands everything, even books about children. I have a third
        reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
        cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate
        the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups
        were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct
        my dedication:

    <h2>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h2>

        Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
        called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
        picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here
        is a copy of the drawing.

    <p>
        In the book it said:
        <em>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
            After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
            six months that they need for digestion."
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after 
        some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. 
        My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/Picture2.png" width="800" height="200" alt="змея кого-то съела">
    <p>
        I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the 
        drawing frightened them.
    </p>
    <p>
        But they answered:
        <em>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa 
        constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not 
        able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a 
        boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always 
        need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/Picture3.png" width="800" height="200" alt="змея съела слона">
    <p>
        The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my 
        drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, 
        and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. 
        That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a 
        magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure 
        of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never 
        understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be 
        always and forever explaining things to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have 
        flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography 
        has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from 
        Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a 
        great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. 
        I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, 
        close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
